# Dentogram

**Dentogram** is an android app which helps the doctors maintain records of the medical history, medicines, treatments, bills, allergies of their patients individually. The application allows the doctor to make notes about their meetings with the patient which can include information like their next appointment date along with the medicine list as well as the prescription. The app also allows the doctor to upload images of the prescription. Usually as the patient keeps a hardcopy record of these things, the doctor can save and share the patient details as a Pdf file which is printable. All the data is backed up on cloud which enables the Doctors to access it through multiple devices and changes made on one device will also refect to the data in the other devices.
